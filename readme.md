# Stan for Econometrics

[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a powerful probabilistic programming language that is useful for Bayesian inference. This is a "quick-start" tutorial for those who want to get familiar with Bayesian modeling in R's interface with Stan, RStan. The files here cover modeling the canonical Eight Schools data set, and also provides information on how to write least squares, logistic, and time series models in Stan.   

## Eight Schools Example

## Parameter Recovery

## Regression Examples

The data used in these examples comes from Green's [Econometric Analysis](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Text/econometricanalysis.htm). 

### Least squares

### Logistic

### Time Series

### Hierarchical
